# Taskflo

## Description
Taskflo is a simple and elegant task manager built for people who want to stay organized without feeling overwhelmed. It’s designed to help users — especially those who tend to forget daily tasks — stay focused and get things done in a calm, intuitive way. Through this project, I learned how to build and connect a full-stack application using modern technologies like React, Node.js, and MongoDB, while prioritizing user experience and clean UI design.
